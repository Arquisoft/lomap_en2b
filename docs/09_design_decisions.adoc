|Decision|Explanation
| React | Taken as a recomendation by some teachers. In addition, one of the members of the group has already worked with it in the past. It allows us to build a good user interface for the application.
| Leaflet | It is the provider we are going to use for obtaining the necessary features around the map. We studied some other different options, such as Mapbox o Google Maps API, but we needed the Api to be completely free.
| Solid Pods Providers | We are trying to allow the user to connect to the application with any solid pod provider.
| React Libraries | In order to make our life easier while the development of the application, we made the decision to include some libraries in the project. These libraries we used are listed on issue #42.
| SonarCloud | This has been presented to us on one laboratory, it measures how many lines of code are being tested using TDD.
| Cucumber | In order to make the mandatory BDD tests, we are going to use a tool that we somewhat knew from other courses in the degree, used to make the acceptance tests.
