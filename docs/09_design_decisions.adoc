|Decision|Why?
| React | Taken as a recomendation by some teachers. In addition, one of the members of the group has already worked with it in the past. It allows us to build a good user interface for the application.
| Leaflet | It is the provider we are going to use for obtaining the necessary features around the map. We studied some other different options, such as Mapbox o Google Maps API, but we needed the Api to be completely free.
| Inrupt | As a constraint in the project, we said we needed to use solid pods, and inrupt is the way we are going to include it in our project. Essentially it provides a way to deal with Solid pods.
