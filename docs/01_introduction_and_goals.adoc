== Introduction and Goals

This project consists on developing an application that allows users to personalize a map of their city. 
In their map they can add the landmarks they want, like shops, sights or restaurants.
In addition, users will be able to share their map information with the users they want while restricting other users from seeing it.

=== Requirements Overview

Users can:

* Add landmarks to the map
* Filter the information on the map
* Share uploaded places with the desired users of the application
* See other users' additions to the map
* Add a review, comments or pictures to the uploaded places
* Manage their data from their SOLID pods
