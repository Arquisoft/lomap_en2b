== System Scope and Context

Lomap is a web application whose objective is to have markers and routes saved in a map where the user has total control of their data. They can also add and share this information with other "friends" sharing the platform. In order to achieve the control of their data SOLID technologies are used all along the project. A user will be able to post an dplace markers, they will also have the capability of viewing the ones of their online "friends".

=== Business context
There is clearly 5 different actors regarding business context, however one is the SOLID pod of both admin and user actor. Which is "integrated" in them making it be a "subsystem". As a result we obtain the following use case scenario.

From that we can say that the main actors have this speciofications:
[cols = "1,2"]

|*User name*
|*Description and functionality*

|*Guest*
|It is the type of user that haven't been identified so only the view for logging in will be displayed.

|*User*
|This type of user is the "average" user as it has an account and it is allowed to create routes or markers, following people and viewing different maps.

|*Admin*
|It is a super user which can make changes on other users, this is done with the objective of moderating the behaviour to avoid unwanted problems.

|*Central System*
|This will be a database in charge of containing the minimal data to make the web application to work and for it not to be heavily slowed down by the decentralized approach.

=== Technical Context

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
