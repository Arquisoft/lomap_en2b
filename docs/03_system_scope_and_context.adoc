== System Scope and Context

Lomap is a web application whose objective is to have markers and routes saved in a map where the user has total control of their data. They can also add and share this information with other "friends" sharing the platform. In order to achieve the control of their data SOLID technologies are used all along the project. A user will be able to post an dplace markers, they will also have the capability of viewing the ones of their online "friends".

There is clearly 5 different actors regarding business context, however one is the SOLID pod of both admin and user actor. Which is "integrated" in them making it be a "subsystem". As a result we obtain the following use case scenario.

From that we can say that the main actors have this speciofications:
[cols = "1,2"]
|===
|*User*
|This type of user is the "average" user as it has an account and it is allowed to create routes or markers, following people and viewing different maps. They connect to the webapp using the pod provider

|*Pod Provider*
|A pod provider using SOLID architecture where all the sensitive data of the users will be stored.

|*lomap*
|The web service itself. Here the user is able to access and modify their maps same as looking the other's.

|*database*
|This will be a database in charge of containing the minimal data to make the web application to work and for it not to be heavily slowed down by the decentralized approach.

|*leaflet*
|Leaflet API is an api using openmaps which is simple and easy to develop in it to create personalizzed maps.
