== Risks and Technical Debts

As it stands now, we have identified some important risks before starting coding the project.

|===
|Risk|Mitigation proposed|Consideration

|Use of technologies we are not used to.
|Consulting the documentation of the languages when necessary, as well as trying to use technologies we know, so as to better concentrate on those we do not. Helping ourselves is also certainly a solution.
|High

|Github use.
|We are all familiar with how to use both git and GitHub, so we do not necessarily consider this as a risk. Nevertheless, it important to remember that working on not-updated branches can have severe consequences on the future, so we must remember to perform frequent commits and atomic branches: branches for a single feature or update.
|Low

|SOLID
|Inform ourselves about SOLID, as well as trying to talk about it ourselves to see if there is anything we have missed. Asking the professor when arriving at a doubt.
|High

|Team members leaving the team during development.
|Assign a feature to two people instead of one, mitigating (though not avoiding) the consequences of a person leaving mid-development. Doing proper documentation in the code and commit messages should also help.
|Medium

|===

Regarding the technical debt, it is probably going to be very high, because we won't be using a single technology we are familiar with (except one member). Both SOLID and React are probably the most difficult parts, and we are going to have huge amounts of technical debt on both of them. Currently, we do not know any mitigation system other than searching possible solutions in Internet.
